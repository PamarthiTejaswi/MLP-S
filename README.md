Consider the dataset that is formed by using the equation y=x^2+ϵ
where ϵ is epsilone which is a small random values (positive or negative) 
Then trained the dataset to perform 
a) Very small MLP (underfits)
b) Medium MLP (fits well)
c) Huge MLP (overfits) 
and also showed the relationship between the training and testing curves.
